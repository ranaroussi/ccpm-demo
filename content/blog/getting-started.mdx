## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Step 1: Account Setup

Creating an account is straightforward. Simply navigate to the signup page and provide the required information:

const createAccount = async (userData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/signup', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(userData),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      return await response.json();
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Account creation failed:', error);
  }
};
```
