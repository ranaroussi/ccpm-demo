# Task: Docker & Deployment - Dockerfile, docker-compose, health checks, deployment guides

## Description

Create comprehensive Docker configuration and deployment setup including Dockerfile for the Next.js application, docker-compose for local development with database, health check endpoints, and detailed deployment guides for various platforms (Vercel, Railway, DigitalOcean).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile for production builds
- [ ] docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented
- [ ] Environment variable configuration documented
- [ ] Deployment guide for Vercel
- [ ] Deployment guide for Railway/DigitalOcean
- [ ] Database migration scripts for production
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Performance optimization in Docker build

## Technical Details

- Implementation approach:
  - Create optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
  - Set up docker-compose with PostgreSQL service
  - Implement health check API endpoint
  - Create deployment-specific configuration
  - Write comprehensive deployment documentation
- Key files/locations:
  - `Dockerfile` - Production Docker configuration
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Local development setup
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production compose override
  - `.dockerignore` - Docker build exclusions
  - `app/api/health/route.ts` - Health check endpoint
  - `scripts/deploy.sh` - Deployment script
  - `docs/deployment.md` - Deployment guide
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 (Foundation) must be completed for basic app structure
- [ ] Database configuration from previous tasks
- [ ] Environment variables defined

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Docker builds successfully
- [ ] docker-compose development environment working
- [ ] Health checks responding correctly
- [ ] Successfully deployed to at least one platform
- [ ] Database migrations work in production
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation complete and tested
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Deployed to staging
