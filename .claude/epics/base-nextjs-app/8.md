# Task: User Management - Profile updates, password changes, admin user list view

## Description

Implement comprehensive user management features including user profile updates, password change functionality, and an admin interface for viewing and managing all users. This builds on the authentication system and user pages to provide full user lifecycle management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can update their profile information (name, email)
- [ ] Users can change their password with current password verification
- [ ] Admin users can view a list of all registered users
- [ ] Admin users can perform basic user management actions (disable/enable)
- [ ] Profile updates are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Password changes follow security best practices
- [ ] Admin interface is protected by role-based access control

## Technical Details

- Implementation approach:
  - Create profile update form with validation
  - Implement password change with bcrypt verification
  - Build admin dashboard with user table
  - Add role-based access control middleware
  - Create API endpoints for user management operations
- Key files/locations:
  - `app/profile/page.tsx` - User profile page
  - `app/admin/users/page.tsx` - Admin user management
  - `app/api/user/profile/route.ts` - Profile update API
  - `app/api/user/password/route.ts` - Password change API
  - `app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - Admin user management API
  - `lib/auth.ts` - Role-based access control utilities

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 4 (Authentication system) must be completed
- [ ] Task 5 (User pages structure) must be completed
- [ ] Database user table with role fields
- [ ] Form validation library (Zod)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 12
