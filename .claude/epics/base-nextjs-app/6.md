# Task: MDX Content System - Documentation and blog routing, syntax highlighting, metadata handling

## Description

Implement a complete MDX-based content system for documentation and blog functionality, including dynamic routing, syntax highlighting for code blocks, frontmatter metadata handling, and content organization structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MDX configuration with Next.js integration
- [ ] Dynamic routing for blog posts (`/blog/[slug]`)
- [ ] Dynamic routing for documentation (`/docs/[...slug]`)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting with Prism.js or similar
- [ ] Frontmatter metadata parsing (title, date, tags, author)
- [ ] Blog index page with post listings and pagination
- [ ] Documentation navigation with hierarchical structure
- [ ] Search functionality for content
- [ ] SEO optimization with metadata generation
- [ ] Table of contents generation for long-form content

## Technical Details

- Implementation approach: Use @next/mdx with remark/rehype plugins
- Key files/locations:
  - `next.config.js` (MDX configuration)
  - `app/blog/page.tsx` (blog index)
  - `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` (blog post)
  - `app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` (documentation)
  - `lib/mdx.ts` (MDX utilities)
  - `content/blog/` (blog posts)
  - `content/docs/` (documentation files)
  - `components/mdx/` (MDX components)
- Use gray-matter for frontmatter parsing
- Implement custom MDX components for enhanced content

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2 (Next.js Foundation) must be completed
- [ ] TypeScript configuration in place

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with full MDX system
- [ ] Tests written and passing for content parsing
- [ ] Documentation updated with content authoring guide
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging with sample content
