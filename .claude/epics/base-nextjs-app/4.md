# Task: NextAuth Integration - Credentials provider, session management, protected routes middleware

## Description

Implement authentication system using NextAuth.js with credentials provider for user login/registration, session management, and middleware for protecting routes. This includes setting up the authentication configuration, creating login/register pages, and implementing route protection.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NextAuth.js installed and configured with credentials provider
- [ ] User authentication flow implemented (login/register/logout)
- [ ] Session management working across the application
- [ ] Protected routes middleware implemented
- [ ] Authentication pages created with proper styling
- [ ] Password hashing and validation implemented
- [ ] Session persistence and security configured
- [ ] Error handling for authentication failures

## Technical Details

- Implementation approach: Configure NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter, create auth pages, implement middleware
- Key files/locations:
  - `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth configuration
  - `/src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities and configuration
  - `/src/middleware.ts` - Route protection middleware
  - `/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login page component
  - `/src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Register page component
  - `/src/components/auth/` - Authentication-related components
  - `/src/lib/validations/auth.ts` - Authentication validation schemas
  - `.env.local` - NextAuth secret and configuration

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 3 completed (Database and Prisma setup)
- [ ] User and Session models defined in database
- [ ] Environment variables configured for NextAuth

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 8-10
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with NextAuth integration and route protection
- [ ] Tests written and passing for authentication flows
- [ ] Documentation updated with authentication setup and usage
- [ ] Code reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Deployed to staging with authentication working end-to-end
