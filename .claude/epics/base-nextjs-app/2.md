# Task: Project Foundation - Next.js 15 setup with Tailwind CSS, essential folder structure, environment configuration

## Description

Set up the foundational structure for a Next.js 15 application with Tailwind CSS for styling. This includes creating the essential folder structure, configuring the development environment, and establishing the basic project configuration files needed for a modern Next.js application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Next.js 15 application initialized with TypeScript support
- [ ] Tailwind CSS installed and configured with proper PostCSS setup
- [ ] Essential folder structure created (components, lib, types, etc.)
- [ ] Environment configuration files created (.env.local, .env.example)
- [ ] Basic layout components and styling established
- [ ] Development server runs without errors
- [ ] TypeScript configuration optimized for Next.js 15

## Technical Details

- Implementation approach: Use create-next-app with TypeScript template, then configure Tailwind CSS
- Key files/locations:
  - `/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
  - `/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
  - `/tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
  - `/postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
  - `/src/app/` - Next.js 15 App Router structure
  - `/src/components/` - Reusable components
  - `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
  - `/src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Dependencies

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Package manager (npm/yarn/pnpm) available
- [ ] Git initialized in project directory

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Tests written and passing for basic components
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed for best practices
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment successfully
