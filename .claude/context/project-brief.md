# Project Brief

## Executive Summary

Building a **minimal, self-hostable Next.js SaaS starter** that provides essential authentication, content management, and deployment capabilities without unnecessary complexity. This project serves as a foundation for developers to rapidly build and deploy SaaS applications with complete control over their infrastructure.

## What It Does

### Core Functionality
The Next.js SaaS Starter is a production-ready template that provides:

1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - User registration with email/password
   - Secure login with session management
   - Password reset via email
   - Protected routes and API endpoints

2. **Content Management**
   - MDX-based documentation system
   - Blog/changelog capabilities
   - Dynamic routing for content pages
   - SEO-optimized content delivery

3. **User Interface**
   - Pre-built component library (shadcn/ui)
   - Responsive dashboard layout
   - Admin panel for user management
   - Accessible, mobile-first design

4. **Infrastructure Ready**
   - Docker containerization for easy deployment
   - Database migrations with Prisma
   - Email service integration
   - Health check endpoints

## Why It Exists

### Problem Statement
Developers building SaaS applications face a common challenge: spending weeks setting up basic infrastructure (authentication, database, UI components, deployment) before writing any business logic. Existing solutions are either:
- **Too complex**: Over-engineered with unnecessary abstractions
- **Too minimal**: Missing critical production features
- **Too expensive**: Require costly SaaS subscriptions
- **Too restrictive**: Lock developers into specific platforms

### Solution
This starter provides the **optimal middle ground**:
- Complete enough to be production-ready
- Simple enough to understand and modify
- Self-hostable for full control
- Built with proven, popular technologies

## Project Scope

## Key Stakeholders

### Direct Stakeholders
1. **Developers/Founders**: Primary users building SaaS products
2. **End Users**: Customers using applications built with the starter
3. **Contributors**: Open-source community members

### Indirect Stakeholders
1. **Hosting Providers**: Platforms where applications are deployed
2. **Service Providers**: Email, database, monitoring services
3. **Technology Partners**: Next.js, Vercel, Prisma teams

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Next.js 15 with App Router
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript in v1)
- Single database support (PostgreSQL)
- Node.js 18+ required

### Resource Constraints
- Single developer effort
- 2-3 week timeline
- No budget for paid services
- Limited to open-source dependencies

### Business Constraints
- Must remain open-source
- Cannot include proprietary code
- No vendor-specific features
- English documentation only

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Use established libraries, security best practices
2. **Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, optimization guidelines

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Adoption Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive docs, video tutorials
2. **Maintenance Burden**
   - Mitigation: Minimal dependencies, clear architecture

### Low Priority Risks
1. **Technology Changes**
   - Mitigation: Use stable versions, document upgrade paths
2. **Competition**
   - Mitigation: Focus on simplicity niche
