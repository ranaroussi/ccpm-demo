# PRD: base-nextjs-app

## Executive Summary

A minimal, self-hostable Next.js SaaS starter application that provides essential authentication, content management through MDX, and a clean, functional user interface. This application serves as a foundation for building SaaS products with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.

## Problem Statement

Developers building SaaS applications often spend significant time setting up basic infrastructure - authentication, user management, content systems, and deployment configurations. Most existing boilerplates are either over-engineered with unnecessary features or too minimal to be production-ready.

**Why now:** The demand for quickly launching MVPs and SaaS products continues to grow, but developers need a middle-ground solution that is both minimal and complete enough for real-world use.

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

1. **SaaS Developer/Founder**
   - Wants to launch MVP quickly
   - Needs basic authentication and user management
   - Requires flexibility to self-host or deploy anywhere
   - Values simplicity over feature richness

2. **End Users (SaaS Customers)**
   - Need secure, reliable access to the application
   - Expect fast, responsive interface
   - Want clear, well-organized content and documentation

### User Journeys

**Developer Journey:**
1. Clone repository and install dependencies
2. Configure environment variables for database and auth
3. Customize branding and content
4. Deploy to preferred hosting solution
5. Iterate on features using established patterns

**End User Journey:**
1. Land on marketing/content pages
2. Sign up with email and password
3. Verify email (optional based on configuration)
4. Access dashboard/application features
5. Manage account settings
6. Read help documentation (MDX content)

### Pain Points Being Addressed
- Lengthy setup time for basic SaaS infrastructure
- Complex authentication implementations
- Lack of content management for documentation/help pages
- Over-complicated deployment processes
- Bloated dependencies and unnecessary features

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Authentication System**
- Username (email) and password registration
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt or similar)
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset flow via email
- Session management (JWT or session-based)
- Protected route middleware
- Remember me functionality

**User Management**
- User profile pages
- Account settings (change password, email)
- User roles/permissions (basic: user, admin)
- Account deletion capability

**Content Management (MDX)**
- MDX file-based content for documentation/help
- Blog/changelog functionality
- Dynamic routing for MDX pages
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Table of contents generation
- SEO metadata support

**Core Application Structure**
- Landing page with feature overview
- Pricing page (static initially)
- Dashboard (authenticated area)
- Admin panel (basic user management)
- 404/500 error pages

**UI Components**
- Minimal design system
- Form components (inputs, buttons, selects)
- Navigation (header, sidebar for dashboard)
- Alerts/notifications
- Modal/dialog system
- Loading states
- Tables for data display

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- First contentful paint < 1.5s
- Time to interactive < 3s
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Optimized bundle size (< 200KB initial JS)

**Security**
- HTTPS enforcement
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention (if using SQL)
- XSS protection
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Secure session handling
- Environment variable management

**Scalability**
- Stateless architecture for horizontal scaling
- Database connection pooling
- CDN-ready static assets
- Efficient API routes

**Development Experience**
- Hot reload in development
- Clear project structure
- Comprehensive README
- Environment variable templates
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier setup

**Deployment**
- Docker support for self-hosting
- Environment-based configuration
- Database migration system
- Health check endpoints
- Deployment guides for common platforms

## Success Criteria

### Launch Metrics
- Setup time from clone to running: < 10 minutes
- Time to deploy: < 30 minutes
- All core features functional on day 1

### Quality Metrics
- 0 critical security vulnerabilities
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Mobile responsive on all pages
- Accessibility score > 85

### Developer Adoption
- Clear documentation coverage > 90%
- Successful deployment rate > 95%
- Positive developer feedback on simplicity

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript in initial version)
- Single database support initially (PostgreSQL recommended)
- English language only for v1
- No real-time features (WebSockets) in initial version
- Limited to server-side rendering and static generation

### Assumptions
- Developers have basic Next.js knowledge
- PostgreSQL or similar database available
- SMTP service available for emails
- Users comfortable with self-hosting have DevOps knowledge
- Modern browser support only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge latest versions)

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly NOT included in this base application:

- Payment processing/billing
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Advanced analytics
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile applications
- API rate limiting per user/plan
- Advanced search functionality
- File upload/storage system
- Webhooks system
- GraphQL API
- Internationalization (i18n)
- A/B testing framework
- Email marketing integration
- Customer support ticketing
- Two-factor authentication
- Social login providers
- Advanced role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Data export functionality

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or MySQL/SQLite as alternatives)
- **Email Service**: SMTP server or service (SendGrid, Postmark, etc.)
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ required
- **npm/yarn**: Package manager

### Internal Team Dependencies
- **Design**: Minimal design system specifications
- **DevOps**: Deployment documentation and Docker configuration
- **Documentation**: Initial user guides and API documentation
- **Testing**: Basic test suite setup

### Third-Party Libraries (Core)
- Next.js 14+
- React 18+
- MDX for content
- Database ORM (Prisma or similar)
- Authentication library (NextAuth.js or custom)
- Email sending library
- CSS framework (Tailwind CSS or vanilla CSS)

## Technical Architecture

### Stack Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React, minimal CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary), SQLite (development)

- **Content**: MDX files with file-system routing
- **Deployment**: Docker containers or Node.js process
